Hey Tammy,

We're good for release! I took some extra time to really make this as 'official' as possible. It has an MIT liscence and it's backed up in the cloud, meaning a couple things: 
- it's capable of handling updates and maintance, and 
- it should be flexible enough to be shared with other departments should we want to do that.

I also added a bunch of failsafes and catches in an attempt to make it as smooth of an experience for the user as possible. I tested it with 5 different calendars and they all worked cleanly, but your full usage will be the real test! Below is a brief guide.

Best,
Emil

Tammy's Cohort Scheduling Tool 
==============
An internal tool created for Bellevue Universiy's College of Science and Technology (CST).
This tool will migrate infomration listed in BU's course calendars into a cohort schedule tracker.
--------------

[SETUP]
One time set up steps:
1. Change the Cohort Schedules Tracking excel file WORKSHEET NAMES to match the FILE NAMES of the calendars. Take for example the Masters of Emergency Managment:
	- In Cohort Schedules.xls the worksheet is titled 'MSEM-MS'
	- The file name of the calendar for the program is 'MSEMGTCMS 0922-603S OL.xls'
	- Go into Cohort Schedules.xls and change the worksheet name to 'MSEMGTCMS'
	- Repeat this step until all of the worksheet names in Cohort Schedules 
	  Tracking.xls match their respective calendar names
	
2. Turn off error indicators in Excel (Gets rid of warnings on dates/numbers).
	- Click the File tab.
	- Click Options.
	- In the Excel Options dialog box, click the Formulas category.
	- Under Error checking rules, clear the "Numbers formatted as text or preceded by 
	  an apostrophe" check box.
	- Clear the "Cells containing years represented as 2 digits" box 
	- Click OK.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[USER GUIDE]
1. Close Cohort Schedules Tracking.xls, it must remain closed until the program raises the 'Complete' flag
2. Launch the tool
3. Under the 'Calendar' field, use the browse button to find the calendar you wisht to add.
4. Under the 'Cohort Schedule' field, use the browse button to select the schedule which will be modified.
5. Press submit, wait for the 'Complete' notification.
6. If you wish to add more calendars, select the other files and submit them one by one. There is no need to change the cohort schedule field for repeated entries. 

[ERRORS]

- Workbook Name Mismatch: The calendar being added has a name other than 'Primary' or 
  'Template'. Chang the workbook name on the calendar to either 'Primary' or 'Template' and this error should resolve. 

- Error: Close Excel Files: The program struggled aquiring permission to edit the files. Make sure to close the Cohort Schedule Tracking.xls. This excel file MUST be closed for the tool to complete its job.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
[LIMITATIONS]
	
	- Cohort Schedule must be accessible. Ensure it is closed during operation of the tool.
	
	- The tool is based on College of Science and Technology's Cohort Schedules Tracking.xls by Tammy Bosely as of January 2023. It will add Program, Course #, Term, Day, Week, Start and End dates.The columns on the Cohort Schedule Tracking.xls MUST remain in the current position, and no new columns may be added or subtracted without interrupting the tool. 

Note: contact emontemayor@bellevue.edu if you wish to modify the tracker file to fit a new infrastructure. Updating or creating alternate versions of the tool is possible.
		
	- The tool is also based on the structure of the current calendars as of January 2023. Any future changes to the calendar formats will require reprogramming the tool.
